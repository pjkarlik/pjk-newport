Simple demo of Conways 'Game of Life', in which we see the birth and death of cells on a rectangular grid. 
The state of a given cell in any generation depends on the state of the cell and its eight immediate 
neighbors in the preceding generation, according to some simple rules:

- If a living cell has two or three neighbors, it remains living; otherwise it dies of loneliness or overcrowding.
- If an empty cell has exactly three neighbors, it becomes living; otherwise, it remains dead.

As simple as these rules may be, they can result in surprising complexity from relatively simple 
initial configurations. Many different types of patterns occur in the Game of Life, which are 
classified according to their behaviour. 

Common pattern types include: still lifes, which do not change from one generation to the next; 
oscillators, which return to their initial state after a finite number of generations; and spaceships, 
which translate themselves across the grid.
