## WebGL, GLSL, Javascript, and Canvas.

This maze created from wang tiles is a WebGL Fragment Shader demo. Everything created is done entirely with math 
and GLSL (the native OpenGL shader language).

[Wang tiles](http://www.cr31.co.uk/stagecast/wang/intro.html) are a popular tool for procedural 
synthesis of textures, heightfields, and mazes. 

The basic concept is a set of square tiles, with each tile edge of a fixed color, are arranged side by side 
in a rectangular grid. All four edges of each tile must 'match' (have the same color/value) as their adjoining neighbor.

In this example I'm actually cutting out the pattern created by the wang tiles into the blocks to create the pathways.
Because shaders are parallel in execution I do a neighbor check for each render pass to determin the edges.
