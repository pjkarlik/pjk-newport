## WebGl, GLSL, JavaScript, and Canvas.

Soothing motion is a WebGL Fragment Shader demo created entirely with math and GLSL (the native OpenGL shader language).

The concept for my work came from [Fonstantin Faraktinov](https://twitter.com/frktnv/status/1484167941025316867) and 
his beautiful animation done in Blender3D. However I wanted to see if I could emulate this looping animation with just 
math.

There is a little bit of timing involved, but mostly this is just splitting space and using a mirror to duplicate the 
objects and movement.

Once the space is split the quarter sections of the spheres move one half space and rotates 180 degrees and then 
changes direction from left, down, up, right. The [domain repetition](http://fabricecastel.github.io/blog/2016-08-17/main.html) does the rest. 

If you look at the animation a square is made up of a 3x3 grid of posts which make the boundaries for the imaginary mirrors.
