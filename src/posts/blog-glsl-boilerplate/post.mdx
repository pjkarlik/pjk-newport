#### Making Shaders
When I first got into shaders and WebGL I wanted to build everything myself, including the boilerplate. 
While this seemed fun at the time, the drawbacks of mantaining that code proved to get a little much. 
It's a good way to learn the basics, and the why and what of setting up a WebGL canvas. However it's a lot,
and definitely started to cut into my creative time. I recently decided to pick up a small library to 
help and this is a short explaination of that library and my setup.


#### Libraries and WebGL
There are a TON libraries out there, a litteral see of them [gist.github.com/dmnsgn/](https://gist.github.com/dmnsgn/76878ba6903cf15789b712464875cfdc)


I make fragment shaders, so really only the most basic setup is needed. For this type of thing 
you would attach a **vertex** and a **fragment** shaders together into a program. That program is then 
compiled and sent to the **GPU**, with the output being rendered on the canvas.

[Twgl webgl](https://twgljs.org/) - is a tiny webgl helper library and ideal for this type of thing.
My setup has a 1/3rd less code than vanilla JS. You can also easily add in geometry or tessilation shaders
textures, framebuffers and more.

#### Set up and Overview

This mirrors the codepen example above with our html having just a canvas element and the vertex and fragment shader. 


The first step is getting the canvas element so we can turn it into a webgl element. Then we setup a var to hold our 
shader program, which is made up of the two "named" scripts in our html.

```js
const gl = document.getElementById("canvas").getContext("webgl2");
const programInfo = twgl.createProgramInfo(gl, [
  "vertexShader",
  "fragmentShader"
]);
```

Shader get data through buffers, so we set some up. You can read the full 
verobse way and why here [webgl2fundamentals.org](https://webgl2fundamentals.org/webgl/lessons/webgl-shaders-and-glsl.html)
```js
const arrays = {
  position: [-1, -1, 0, 1, -1, 0, -1, 1, 0, -1, 1, 0, 1, -1, 0, 1, 1, 0]
};
const bufferInfo = twgl.createBufferInfoFromArrays(gl, arrays);
```

Next is the render loop, which basically keeps calling itself and updating our program
with any curernt variables needed. 


Each frame gets updated with the current canvas size to catch and browser resizing.
Then any specific data we want to send gets passed in as a uniform (variable) by calling
the program, calling that buffer we set, and then setting what the new values are.


This gets executed and passed into the shader once we call the drawBufferInfo command, and
repeate for each fame we want it to be "alive".

```js
const render = (time) => {
  twgl.resizeCanvasToDisplaySize(gl.canvas, 1.0);
  gl.viewport(0, 0, gl.canvas.width, gl.canvas.height);

  const uniforms = {
    u_time: time,
    u_resolution: [gl.canvas.width, gl.canvas.height],
  };

  gl.useProgram(programInfo.program);
  twgl.setBuffersAndAttributes(gl, programInfo, bufferInfo);
  twgl.setUniforms(programInfo, uniforms);
  twgl.drawBufferInfo(gl, bufferInfo);

  requestAnimationFrame(render);
};
```

Finally to start it, add an eventListener to make sure its all loaded.
```js
window.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", (event) => {
  requestAnimationFrame(render);
});
```

You can check out more examples at using this library here at [twgljs.org/#examples](https://twgljs.org/#examples).
For fun my old vanilla long and overly verobse first try is here -> [boilerplate](https://github.com/pjkarlik/glsl-boilerplate). 
Has some good comments for what thigns do what when setting up WebGL and WebGL2.

Thanks for reading.
