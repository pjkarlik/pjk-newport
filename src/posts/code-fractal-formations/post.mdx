## WebGL, GLSL, JavaScript and Canvas. 

The original project was created as NFT's on the **Tezos** blockchain and it created a unique Fractal object 
each time it was minted. 

To main part of this WebGL Shader is the fractal formulas. Basically I am folding space several times by a few formulas.
Then draw a box in the center of that space - unfold - and the box now looks like a fractal. 
To make these shapes 3D I am using the technique called Raymarching. [Raymarching](https://michaelwalczyk.com/blog-ray-marching.html), 
much like **ray tracing**, uses math to calculate the surface of objects based on distances. That is then turned into
color, depth, shadow in a Fragment Shader.

Once online users were able to mint a special fractals all randomly generated based on deterministic 
hash values. Meaning that every time a specific hash is loaded, a repeatable specific random value is returned. 

This static demo version above will allow you to see some of the variations by hitting the rerun button or reloading this page.
